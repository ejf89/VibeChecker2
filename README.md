# VIBECHECKER2

VIBECHECKER2 is a CLI app that uses the Twitter API.

  Begin by entering a word or sentence that you want to check the "vibe" of. The Vibe Checker will then calculate the overall vibe of your search query. Do people currently think "dogs" are bad or good? How do people feel about their parents, their commute, their food? How should you feel about the movie A Dog's Purpose or the new Drake album? The vibe checker checks the vibe of anything you want to know how to feel about in real time.

  VibeChecker2 can also list the history of the vibe of the query you entered to see how feelings have shifted.
